### Project: Real Estate Dashboard

The purpose of this project is to deliver a better perception of real-estate data. For this, we have taken a dataset of real estate. Power BI is used for the visualization of data. Along with the dataset, a few measures were also created to highlight the KPIs. By using relevant visualizations different stats are illustrated that can help buyers or sellers for property dealing.
